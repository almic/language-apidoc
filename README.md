The official unofficial atom grammar package for [apiDoc](http://apidocjs.com/). Install this and *it just works*. No extra setup neccessary.

* ```apm install language-apidoc```

I found apiDoc and was surprised it didn't have an Atom grammar yet, so I made it.

This should work with any languages that support block comments for documentation. Please [open an issue](https://github.com/almic/language-apidoc) if you find a language that isn't getting the right highlighting.
